About me:

Software developer, with experience in Web Development (mainly Python & JavaScript).

I’ve worked for most of my career as a Back-end Developer, being very familiar with the development and maintenance of REST and GraphQL APIs (with relational and NoSQL databases, such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB, respectively), using Python and Node.js (JavaScript and TypeScript), with Python being the language I feel most comfortable with. I have also worked as a Full Stack Developer, being proficient in developing User Interfaces using Vue.js/Nuxt. Currently, I work as a Back-end Developer using Python and Terraform to build applications on top of Cloud Services from AWS such as Lambdas, S3 Buckets, SQS Queues, SNS topics, Databases with RDS, API Gateways and etc. Additionally, I am proficient in working with containers (Docker, docker-compose), microservices, CI/CD pipelines, stored procedures, cloud services (AWS, Azure), serverless, API testing and documentation, log monitoring and data visualization. I guide my professional practice by following Test-Driven Development principles and programming paradigms such as Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming.

With regard to the technologies I’ve used along the way, I’ve worked with Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Flask, Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, Nuxt, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, Terraform, nginx, Datadog and Cloud Providers such as AWS and Azure.
